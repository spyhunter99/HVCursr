Introduction

This is a collection of large and brightly colored animated cursors for Windows 95/98/ME or NT/2000. These cursors are designed for any application which needs a cursor big enough to find, but still interesting to look at. Since they need only 256 color video or higher, they can be used with most laptops, where larger cursors are needed. They are excellent for children or individuals with limited visual acuity. There are now 10 different color cursor schemes in the set, for a total of 257 cursors. They provide a wide selection of replacements for all the standard Windows mouse pointers. It will also replace the "link" cursor whenever you use the "single click" setting for "folder options" in newer versions of Windows. For installation see the "Instructions" below.

Version History

Version 1.0  (8/8/99) -- Initial issue of 143 High Visibility Animated Cursors.

Version 1.0a (2/18/00) -- Updated readme file for new website (Geocities to XOOM).

Version 2.0  (8/21/00) -- Four new color schemes added (light blue, white, black, and inverse), for a total of 257 cursors. I was the first cursor maker to produce animated inverse cursors and felt they would also look good with this set. The black and white cursors were specifically requested by some of my users (see I do read my email).

Version 2.0a (10/5/00) -- Updated readme file for new URL (XOOM bought by NBCi).

Version 2.0b (6/28/01) -- Updated readme file for new website (NBCi out of business).

Instructions for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000

General

The installation file is designed to work with all normal default Windows installations. (If you have a non-standard Windows installation you can copy the cursors to your "Cursors" folder after unzipping them and then install them from "Control Panel" individually as described in Steps 2 and 4.) If you are not familiar with the terms used in these directions, get help from someone who is.

Installation

1. Unzip the HVCursr.zip file into a temporary folder using an unzip utility such as WinZip. It is preferable to keep the default folder of "\Temp\hivis", otherwise type in the folder you used when prompted during installation for the "downloaded files". In Windows Explorer, go to the temporary folder you just made and right click on "INSTALHV.INF". Select (double click) "Install". You should see a message that the cursor files are being copied to your computer. (If you get an error message about no program being associated with this file, you have a problem with your Windows 95/98 system installation, which can be repaired by following the directions at "http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q145/8/10.asp".)

2. In Control Panel, double click on "Mouse" for Mouse Properties. Click on "Pointers" in Mouse Properties.

3. Ten cursor schemes are provided with this set. Under "Scheme", click on the arrow for the drop down menu and double click on the desired color (Red, Yellow, Blue, Light Blue, Green, Purple, Rainbow, Inverse, White or Black) of the "High Visibility Animated" entries. You should now see the appropriate High Visibility Animated Cursor for each default mouse pointer.

4. To keep the set shown, just click on "Apply" and go to step 5. To change any of the cursors, select that cursor and click on "Browse", double click on the "HIVIS" folder, then select the new cursor desired from those listed. Highlight the desired cursor and click "Open." You should now see the new cursor shown for that event. Continue this until you have all the cursors the way you want. At this time you may want to save this as a custom scheme. Type in a scheme name and click on "Save As". To initiate the new cursors, click on "Apply".

5. Exit Mouse Properties and Control Panel. Delete your temporary folder. You're done! 

Note:  The "application in background" cursors have "APPS" or "APP" in their name and the "busy" cursors have "BUSY" or "BSY" in their name. All "application in background" cursors can also be used as the normal cursor. Cursors with "LINK" are able to be used as the browser cursor for Windows 98 if you have IE4 (unfortunately Microsoft discontinued this in IE5). However, link cursors can be used as the normal cursor. The "BUSY5" cursors are 60 second timers and can be used to measure waiting time for your applications.

To uninstall:

1. Select new cursors that are not in the "\Cursors\HIVIS" directory for your default cursors using Steps 2-5 under Installation. When done, go to Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel, select "High Visibility Animated Cursors", and select "Add/Remove". This removes all the cursors and registry entries that were installed.

2. In Windows Explorer, delete empty folder "\Cursors\HIVIS" in your default windows folder. Do NOT delete your "\Cursors" folder!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAUTION When Using Inverse Cursors!

* Do not use the "Cursor Trails" option under the "Motion" Tab in the "Mouse" Aplet in Control Panel. This option inverses the inverse part of the cursor making it match the background and essentially become invisible, except for the outline and the trails. If you accidently do this you can still see the cursor outline and can unselect "Cursor Trails."

* If you do not use a white background for your main window, your text insertion pointer may be too similar in color to your background and may "disappear." This is usually only a problem with setups using 16 or 256 colors. This is easily solved by going to a white or other primary color background to get proper contrast. This is done by going to "Settings," opening "Control Panel," opening "Display," selecting the "Appearance" tab, selecting "Window" under "Item," clicking on "Color" and selecting the white block, and then clicking "Apply" and "Close."

The 3D Maroon Animated Cursors contain sports related cursors not carried in the other sets, but which can be used with any of them.

The original animations for the "standard" cursors used in the first 3D Green Animated Cursor set I made were modeled after a freeware blue 3D animated and static cursor set developed by Chris Prescott. I wish to thank him for permission to use his ideas. His cursor set is available at http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/4467.

High Visibility Animated Cursor Scheme "ZIP" File List for Version 2.0c

To conserve room, I am not listing all 260 files in this zip file individually. The "*" for the third letter represents the ten possible color variations "r", "y", "g", "b", "l", "p", "rn", "i", "w", or "k" representing the colors red, yellow, green, blue, light blue, purple, rainbow, inverse, white or black, respectively. The only exceptions are for the rainbow cursors. The rainbow cursors are only "ani" files, do not have "cat eyes", and use abbreviations in the name (such as app or bsy) to keep it to 8 characters as required for the installation file.
